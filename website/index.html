							<p>Most vulgar terms are about equally common. The f-word seems particularly popular.  Curses and violent words are about equally frequent. Perjoratives against women are disturbingly common, while the one hispanic ethnic slur is rarely used. In general, curses are more popular than the control words tweet and twitter. Do you agree?</p>

							<p><small>We observe many counties for which we collected no tweats, particularly in the great plains and mountain west. Though we population-correct our tweet values, this indicates we are technically better able to capture tweets from populous areas on the East and West Coasts and in the industrial Midwest. Nevertheless, we do capture often relatively high values for some rural counties. Aside from this coastal concentraiton, which may relate to population, we do not see broad regional differences in vulgarity, either overall or for specific words. Do you agree?</small></p>

							<p><small>We see interesting patterns in the volume of tweets we collect, while observing that relative vulgarity is quite consistent over time. Examining different dates, we see a wide range the number of tweets we observed. However, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern. For all dates, the volume of vulgar tweets tracks with the number of innocuous control tweets. Thus despite fluctuations in overall tweet volume, the relative vulgarity ratio is consistent over time. Evidently, people do not curse relatively more frequently on certain days, such as weekends or mondays.</small></p><p><small>Aggregating tweets by hour of day, we see a peak in Twitter volume in the afternoon and another at midnight. Tweet volumes are lowest at 9AM and 6PM. We hypothesize that this is reflective of the morning and evening commutes. People are then active on twitter throughout the day, peaking at the end of the work day (4-5PM). Twitter volume increases steadily throughout the evening to another peak at mightnight, before falling steadily as the hour grows increasingly late. There is a small spike in tweeting from 6-7AM, which may reflect users waking up. Interestingly, the relative vulgarity of control-corrected Twitter activity is fairly consistent throughout the day. Users are evidently just as inclined to curse during the workday as they are at 3AM. We do see a spike in relative vulgarity at 9AM. We hypothesize that this may reflect the frustrations of the morning commute.</small></p>

						<p><small>None of our social factors correlates strongly with twitter vulgarity. That said, higher vulgarity values are observed among those counties with lower income and educational attainment. These trends are noisy and not clearly linear. We observe many low-density counties with high twitter vulgarity. Any tweets collected for low-population counties will translate to high relative vulgarity. Rural counties with lower income and attainment may therefore bias our observations. Interestingly, we see higher vulgarity in counties with lower crime rates. This may also represent rural counties. Do you agree?</small></p>
